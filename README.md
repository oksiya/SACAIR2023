# SACAIR2023 - Satellite Image Classification Competition

Satellite image classification poses unique challenges, particularly when confronted with imbalanced and limited datasets. In addressing these challenges, I explored two distinct approaches within my study. First, I conducted experiments using the dataset in its natural imbalanced state, and second, I employed resampling techniques to create a more balanced representation. Additionally, to mitigate the constraints imposed by a small dataset, I incorporated data augmentation strategies.

My methodology involved the utilization of the VGG16 base model, leveraging its pre-trained weights to enhance the learning process. Through a comprehensive training regimen spanning 20 epochs, I observed intriguing results. Notably, both the imbalanced and balanced datasets exhibited remarkable model performance, achieving a perfect accuracy of 100% for both the training and validation sets.

This study contributes valuable insights into the effectiveness of different strategies in the context of satellite image classification, shedding light on the impact of dataset balance and augmentation techniques. The implications of my findings extend beyond the specific challenges posed by imbalanced and small datasets, providing a foundation for further exploration and refinement in the realm of satellite imagery analysis.
